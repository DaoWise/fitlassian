## Description

Are you tired of watching your software development team struggle with the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle? As programmers, they are the driving force behind some of the greatest technological advancements of our time, but the reality is that programming work requires long hours of sitting, which can lead to obesity, heart disease and diabetes. And despite the best efforts to implement the Scrum framework, which uses short periods of focused work called sprints, they often lack the inspiration and motivation to keep employees engaged, and even more they don't even focus on the health and well being of the employee.

This is where FitLassian comes in. Our gamified platform offers a revolutionary solution to the age-old problem of programming work. By assigning kilometers as a unit of measure for task complexity, FitLassian motivates developers to stay active and run in real life, thus using kilometers as sprint points. Their running is tracked, and they earn points for their efforts, which they can use to upgrade their virtual avatar on the Jira board and compete against their colleagues in a game.

FitLassian not only helps developers to estimate the complexity of their tasks and work more efficiently, but also encourages them to adopt a healthier, more active lifestyle. FitLassian is a game changer for the corporate industry, making software development more productive and fun, while taking care of the employee's health and well being. By incorporating FitLassian, companies can not only increase the efficiency and productivity of their software development teams, but also promote a culture of good health and well-being among their employees.
